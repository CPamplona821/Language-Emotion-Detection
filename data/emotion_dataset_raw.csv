Noong Nobyembre 2013, napanood si Brandi sa Watch What Happens Live at sinabing kinausap umano ito ng dating karelasyon ni Joanna. Si Mohamed Hadid, na noon ay kasal sa cast member ng Real Housewives of Beverly Hills na si Yolanda Foster habang nasa relasyon, ang nagsabing ang kanyang ""p--sy smelled."" (Classy pa rin naman ang pagkakabanggit dito ni Brandi.) Noong Disyembre, gumawa ng mga panibagong komento si Glanville, 42, sa kanyang pagharap sa YouTube at sinabing, ""You can't help the odor situation."" Makalipas ang ilang linggo, nagpadala ng sulat ang mga abogado ni Krupa kay Brandi tungkol sa kanilang planong pagsampa ng kaso. Nakalakip sa sulat ng abogado ni Joanna na, ""You knew your statements were false and that such were damaging and humiliating to Mrs. Krupa and/or her husband and subjected Mrs. Krupa... to hatred, ridicule, contempt and/or injury."" ""Moreover, it appears you make false statements about Mrs. Krupa to make yourself marketable and to associate your name with a celebrity in attempt to 'tag' yourself with her for media and personal searches and/or to create a brand for yourself for monetary and attempted celebrity status,"" parte pa rin ng sulat. ""Your statements are malicious and knowingly false."" Laman ng kaso ang umano'y danyos sa pagtitiis ni Krupa na mas mataas pa sa $15,000."

Isang host sa Orlando-based Real Radio 104.1 ang nag-udyok sa mga taong dumalo sa show na tanungin si Bill tungkol sa mga alegasyon at kunin ang kanyang kasagutan, at nag-alok ng cash ang istasyon ng cash at mga premyo para sa pinakamagandang footage. Ngunit walang ni isa mang nagtanong kay Bill. Sinabi ni Bill sa Florida Today na ang ganitong mga alok sa mga nanonood sa kanya ay nanganganib na lumikha ng ""frat house mentality.""

Hindi rin umano nakarehistro si Lazatin bilang VAT taxpayer dahil lumagpas ang kanyang annual income sa VAT threshold na P1.5 milyon.

""Evidently, he has been carrying this hatred ever since."" Sa nasabing libro, isinulat ni Ritz ang pagiging teenage parent ni Franklin, ang paghihiwalay ng magulang niya, at ang pagiging lulong sa alak at iba pa. ""The sensitive questions -- Aretha's mother leaving family, Aretha having two babies while still in her teens, Aretha being beaten by her first husband... were off-limits,"" nakasaad sa librong isinulat ni Ritz. ""In my view, my two years of working on 'From These Roots' resulted in my failure to actualize the great potential in Aretha's narration. I didn't do what I set out to do."" Marami nang biography na naisulat si Ritz, partikular na sina Etta James, Rick James at Ray Charles. Siya ay apat na beses na pinarangalan ng Ralph Gleason Music Book Award, at noong nakaraang taon ay tumanggap siya ng ASCAP Timothy White Award para sa outstanding musical biography para sa Buddy Guy book, When I Left Home. Marami rin siyang naisulat na nobela, essay, at artikulo. ""I think the book in the deepest way is an appreciation. And when I say appreciation, it's just not an appreciation of her art; it's an appreciation of the challenges of her life and the appreciation how hard it is to kind of navigate your way through the complexities of show business culture,"" sabi ni Ritz sa The Associated Press noong Lunes. Isinulat niya na si Franklin ang nagbigay ng ideya sa pakikipagtulungan sa From These Roots, ngunit ang kanilang ideya para sa nasabing proyekto ay magkaiba. ""When I renewed my research for this book, I did so without Aretha's blessing, but I did have the support of three Aretha's closest relatives,"" pahayag ni Ritz. Inilunsad ang pinakabagong album ni Franklin na Aretha Franklin Sings the Great Diva Classics isang linggo bago ang libro ni Ritz noong nakaraang buwan. Pasok sa ikatlong puwesto ang nasabing album sa Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop albums chart."

Joy,"Dumating ang Papa sa bansa para sa isang pastoral visit na naghatid sa kanya sa Leyte kung saan nakapiling niya ang mga sinalanta ng bagyo sa isang open-air na misa na inulan, bilang pagtupad sa kanyang pangako noong 2013 na darating siya upang makidalamhati sa mga biktima ng supertyphoon Yolanda. Bago siya dumating sa Pilipinas, naakit niya ang atensiyon ng buong mundo sa kanyang mga pagsisikap na ireporma ang Simbahang Katoliko Romano mula sa loob nito, lalo na ang mga ginagawa ng Curia at ng Vatican Bank. Nanawagan siya para sa isang Synod on the Family na muling sumuri sa mga sinaunang paniniwala at konserbatibong pag-uugali - na kanyang inaasahan - na maaaring maglaan ng puwang para sa mga Katolikong homoseksuwal at mga mag-asawang naghiwalay. Ngunit ang kanyang pagsisikap upang lumaganap ang kapayapaan ang mas kikilingan sa mga deliberasyon ng Nobel Peace Prize committee. Titingnan nito kung paano niya inimbitahan ang mga pangulo ng Israel at Palestine na samahan siya sa isang ""prayer summit"" sa Vatican noong bumisita siya sa Holy Land noong Hunyo ng nakaraang taon. Habang kinokondena niya ang pagmamalupit ng Islamic State sa mga Kristiyano sa Syria at Iraq, nagpahayag din siya ng simpatiya para sa mga Muslim na nagdurusa dahil iniuugnay sila sa terorismo gayong, aniya, ang kanila ay isang relihiyon ng kapayapaan. Bago siya nagtungo sa Pilipinas noong nakaraang buwan, ang mga leader na Muslim ay humiling kay Pope Francis ang kanyang suporta at pagpapala sa sarili nilang pagsiskap para sa kapayapaan sa Mindanao. Ang kanyang tungkulin bilang peacemaker ay kinilala ni United States President Barack Obama - sa kung paano siya nagpadala ng mga liham kina President Obama at President Raul Castro ng Cuba how he sent letters to President Obama and Cuba President Raul Castro na humihimok sa kanila na resolbahin ang humanitarian questions, partikular na sa palitan ng mga bilanggong tangan magkabilang panig. Naging punong abala ang Papa sa isang pagpupulong sa Vatican at kalaunan, ipinahayag nina Obama at Castro ang pagtatapos ng kalahating siglo ng alitan ng US at Cuba. Ito si Pope Francis, na nakikita ang peacemaking bilang mahalagang sangkap ng kanyang pagkapapa. Kung tutuusin siya ang Vicar of Christ na, sa Kanyang Sermon on the Mount na naitala ni San Mateo, sinabing ""Mapapalad ang mapagpayapa, sapagkat sila'y tatawaging mga anak ng Diyos"" (Mt 5:9). May iba pang nominado para sa Nobel Peace Prize. Kabilang doon sina Edward Snowden, na naglantad ng American electronic surveillance sa buong mundo; isang Russian newspaper - ang Novaya Gazeta - na kritikal kay President Vladimir Putin; at Mussie Zerrai, isang Eritrean priest na umayuda sa mga migranteng Africano na tumatawid sa Mediteranean upang makatagpo ng bagong buhay sa Europe."

Pero kailangan pa ring limitahan ang paggamit nito. Kailangang gabayan ng mga guro at magulang ang mga kabataan sa tama at balanseng paggamit ng social media at ng Internet.

Tuwing may Simbang Gabi, kapag kumakanta ako sa misa kasabay ng pagtilaok ng mga tandang, hinihiling ko ang maraming bagay. Hinihiling ko ang ilang mahihiwagang sandali na nasa tono ang choir na aking kinabibilangan sa okasyong iyon. At kapag nagkaisa ang mga himig ng mga miyembro ng choir, tinatanong ko sa aking sarili kung ganito rin ba kaganda ang himig ng mga anghel sa kalangitan.

Ang iba sa kanila ay nakangiti, ang iba naman ay parang walang naririnig ngunit nakatingin sa amin o sa altar. Hinihiling ko sa mga sandaling iyon na sana ay maunawaan ko kung bakit hindi nagkakaisa ang expression ng mga mukha ng mga parokyano sa aming pag-awit. Gayunman, patuloy kami sa pag-awit at pagsisikap na sana ay mabigyan namin ng hustisya ang sangkap at pahiwatig ng liriko ng aming awit. Oo nga, marami akong kahilingan, ngunit alam ko na sa halip na humiling ako na mapakinggan ang tunay na damdamin ng aming inaawit, kailangang hilingin ko rin na sana ay mapakinggan ko ang tinig ng Diyos kapag Siya ay nagsalita. Sa halip na mabatid ko ang pahiwatig ng mga expression sa mga mukha ng mga nakikinig sa aming choir, kailangang hilingin ko rin na sana ay makita ng aking puso si Jesus at hindi ang kalituhan sa daigdig na ito. Ang pangangarap ay pag-asa na makukuha ko ang nais ko mula sa Diyos. Ang panalangin ay isang apela na makuha nawa ng Diyos ang nais Niyang makamtan sa akin. Ang Pasko ay isang oportunidad upang isipin kung ano ang ibinigay ng Diyos sa atin at kung ano ang maaari nating ibigay sa Kanya."

Nang umupo siya sa puwesto bilang alkalde, bumulaga kay Estrada ang malaking utang sa kuryente kasabay ng banta sa Meralco na puputulan ang city hall ng supply ng elektrisidad kung hindi agad ito mababayaran.

Pero sinabi ko sa kanila na puputulin din namin ang kanilang mga poste sa Maynila,"" pabirong inihayag ni Estrada. Noong Marso 18, ginawaran ng Meralco ang pamahalaan ng Maynila ng Special Luminary Award matapos mabayaran nito ang halos P57 milyong utang sa supply ng tubig at P517 milyong halaga ng withholding tax na kinolekta ng administrasyon ni Lim mula sa mga empleyado subalit hindi ibinayad sa Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). Tadtad din ng utang ang Manila city government sa mga supplier at kontratista. Subalit sa pagsapit ng Hulyo, umaasa si Estrada na mababayaran na ang lahat ng utang ng lokal na pamahalaan mula sa mga utility company. Ito ay dahil sa pagtaas ng revenue collection ng siyudad bunsod ng adjustment na ipinatupad sa real property tax, business tax at community tax."

Joy,"""Tingnan natin, pero may plano 'yan, alam niya kasing malapit na siyang magretiro sa showbiz lalo na ngayong ikakasal na sila ni Marian (Rivera),"" sitsit ng grupong nakausap namin noong Setyembre. Pero nagsabi noon si Dingdong na wala siyang planong pumasok sa pulitika dahil nga puwede naman daw siyang tumulong kahit wala siya sa posisyon. Kaya tinext namin ang manager ng aktor na si Perry Lansigan kung magpupulitika nga ba ang alaga niya, ""Wala akong alam,"" kaswal na sabi sa amin. Naniniwala pa rin kami, Bossing DMB sa kasabihan na kapag may usok, may apoy lalo na't pawang nasa business sector ang mga nakausap namin dahil humingi raw ng suporta sa kanila ang kampo ng aktor. Sila rin ang nagkuwento na maraming bishop ang darating sa kasal nina Dingdong at Marian na abot sa 200 ang unang plano, pero hindi na kinaya ng budget kaya iilan lang ang dumalo. Kaya hihintayin namin ang taong 2016 kung ano ang final answer ni Dingdong sa pagpasok niya sa pulitika. Samantala, sinulat din namin dito sa Balita ng parehong araw ang pagpasok ni Sharon Cuneta sa pulitika. Sinulat namin na may nagkuwento sa aming kakandidato para mayor ng Pasay City si Sharon at pinag-uusapan din ito sa business sector. ""Hindi pa lang ina-announce kasi maaga pa, pero hintayin mo,"" tsika ng source sa amin. ""It's a 70-30 sa pagtakbo ni Sharon, wait mo lang."" Bagamat ilang beses nang sinabi ni Sharon na wala siyang planong pasukin ang pulitika dahil magulo at baka hindi niya kayanin ang intriga at kalakaran dito. Sa presscon nina KC Concepcion at Paulo Avelino para sa episode nilang ""Exchange Gift"" sa Give Love of Christmas (bukas na ang pilot telecast) ay sinabi ng aktres na hindi siya aware sa plano ng ina nang may magtanong tungkol sa isyu. Hindi pa raw ito napag-uusapan sa pamilya, pero kung anuman ang plano ng ina ay malalaman din naman ito kaagad ng publiko."

Sinabi ni Wozniacki na kumpiyansa siyang magagawa niyang makapaglaro sa Melbourne Park, bagamat ang treatment na kanyang natanggap sa courtside ay hindi nagpawala ng iniindang sakit.

Ang 21-anyos na si Barriga ay maraming katimbang sa 49 kg class habang maraming nakalinya para palitan ang 26-anyos na si Suarez sa 60 kg division. Matatandaan na huling nabigo sina Barriga at Suarez na makatuntong sa 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics matapos na kapwa mabigo sa kanilang krusyal na labanan para sa Top 2 sa ginaganap na ranking tournament ng AIBA Pro Boxing.

""We're very glad to see a consciousness in the Filipino about things that are happening globally like Ebola (outbreak) and Gaza (siege). It shows that they are now more mature about their searches,"" aniya. Bukod sa entertainment and current events, nagpakita rin ang mga Pinoy ng mainit na interes sa sports sa 70% ng top 10 events searches na karamihan ay may kinalaman sa boxing, football at tennis. Narito ang kumpletong listahan ng Google Philippines' top search items for the year batay sa category:"

Shame,"Sinabi ni De Lima na isa sa 20 preso mula NBP ang humiling ng lechon para sa kanilang selebrasyon sa loob ng selda. Iginiit ng kalihim na base sa umiiral na batas, hindi dapat pinayagang maipasok ang isang lechon sa piitan. ""Somehow, during those times [baka may] lumapit doon sa mga drug inmate na regular detainees na nasa NBI detention facility at baka 'yun ang posibleng nagpuslit din ng mga contraband na 'yan, especially cash,"" pahayag ni De Lima. Kinumpirma ni NBI Director Virgilio Mendez na dalawang lechon ang ipinasok sa NBI detention center noong holiday. Ayon sa ilang imbestigador ng NBI, ang asawa ni Herbert Colangco, isa sa 20 high-profile inmate, ang nag-deliver ng lechon subalit hindi siya pinayagan ng jail guard na makalapit sa preso kaya iniwan na lang niya ang lechon sa gate ng pasilidad."
Joy,"Mismong ang Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) ay hindi makapaniwala sa mga ulat na ang kagawaran ang nasa likod ng planong gibain ang isang istruktura sa Maharlika Highway sa Sariaya, Quezon para sa pagpapalawak ng kalsada."

Tinapos ni Carmelo Anthony ang kanyang 4-for-19 na gabi sa pagmintis sa isang 3-pointer sa mga huling segundo at nalaglag ang Knicks sa kanilang ikaanim na sunod na pagkabigo para sa 4-16 na kartada. Nagdagdag si Tim Hardaway Jr. ng 20 puntos at 18 naman ang kay Amare Stoudemire, kasama ang 9 rebounds para sa Knicks, na sinubukang sorpresahin ang Cavs sa ikalawang pagkakataon ngayong season. Ngunit hindi nagawa ng New York, na sinira ang unang laro ni James mula nang magbalik sa Cleveland sa kanilang 95-90 na panalo noong Oktubre 30, na mapanatili ang pakikipagsabayan makaraang lumamang ng 7 sa huling quarter. Naipasok ni James ang isang 3-pointer para makuha ang 86-85 na abante sa natitirang 3:54, sinundan niya ito ng isang fast-break dunk para sa 3 puntos na kalamangan, may 3:25 pa ang nalalabi. Gumawa si Kevin Love ng 11 puntos at 11 rebounds para sa Cavs, na nag-average ng 109.8 puntos sa kanilang huling apat na pagwawagi ngunit nahirapan sa opensa sa larong ito, maliban kay Irving."

Inanunsiyo ni UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, na hindi nakilala sa kanyang rock star persona, ang inisyatiba sa isang MTV-style video kung saan ibinigay niya ang kanyang boto sa 1970 hit ni Stevie Wonder na ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered."" Sinabi ni Ban na ang awitin - kilalang paborito ni US President Barack Obama - ay kumatawan sa kanyang mga pag-asa para sa isang matagumpay na kasunduan sa climate change sa isang UN-led conference sa Paris sa huling bahagi ng taong kasalukuyan. Idineklara ng United Nations noong 2012 ang International Day of Joy - na kasabay ng unang araw ng tagsibol sa Northern Hemisphere - matapos ang inisyatiba ng Bhutan, ang lupain sa Himalayan na sumusukat sa ""Gross National Joy"" imbes na sa standard economic indicator. ""On this day we are using the universal language of music to show solidarity with the millions of people around the world suffering from poverty, human rights abuses, humanitarian crises and the effects of environmental degradation and climate change,"" ani Ban. Noong nakaraang taon, ang International Day of Joy ay inimbitahan ang music fans sa buong mundo na sumayaw sa patok na awitin ni Pharrell Williams na ""Happy,"" na naging viral sensation."

Fear,"Ito ang inihayag kahapon ng Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), at sinabing umabot din sa 59 ang nasugatan na binubuo ng 40 BIFF at 19 na mililtar.

Cirilito Sobejana, ng 6th Infantry (Kampilan) Division at commander ng Joint Task Force Central, na sinimulan noong huling linggo ng Mayo hanggang sa kasalukuyan. ""We will go after the bandits to safeguard the civilians and put an end to this menace of society. For as long as they still exist, I will not stop, it will continue. We are doing our best effort to put a rapid conclusion to this problem, because the more we prolong it, the more it prolongs the agony of many civilians in Maguindanao,"" sabi ni Sobejana.

Anger,"Madaling maiwala ang momentum lalo na kung marami kang ginagawang iba pa. Kung mayroon kang proyekto na gusto mo talagang sumulong, maghanap ka ng paraan upang mabantayan mo ang progreso nito. Kumuha ng maliit na kalendaryo (maaari ring kalendaryo sa iyong cellphone) at itala roon kung hanggang saan na ang inabot ng iyong proyekto at ano dapat ang mararating pagsapit ng itinakdang panahon. Maaari ka ring gumawa ng listahan ng sunud-sunod na hakbang tungo sa tagumpay ng iyong proyekto at lagyan ng check ang mga natapos na gawain. Puwede ka ring magsabi sa isang matapat na kaibigan tungkol sa iyong pagsisikap upang makamusta ka nito pagdating ng panahon."
Joy,"Bigyan daw ni Marion ng pagkakataon ang iba dahil artista na siya at nanalo na ng ilang awards bilang bagong composer at recording artist in so short a time. Idagdag pa raw ang pagiging trending worldwide hit ng komposisyon niya para kay Kathryn Bernardo na You Don't Know Me at ng Kiss Goodbye ni Alex Gonzaga sa debut albums ng dalawang young actress/singers. ""First of all, I'm a big fan of PBB eversince. Pangarap ko noon pa man na makita ang sarili ko na nag-i-struggle sa iba't ibang tasks ng housemates. Hindi pa naman po ako sikat. I have been in the business for more than a year lang at alam kong malaki ang matututuhan ko sa loob ng Bahay ni Kuya. Kulang na kulang pa ang nalalaman ko. May nakasabay naman akong nag-audition din na artista na, pero hindi siya na-bash na tulad ko,"" naguguluhang pahayag ni Marion. Sinabi rin sa kanya ni Direk Lauren Dyogi na hindi na niya kailangang mag-PBB. ""I told him na I feel the need for it. Siguro, susundin ko na lang ang concern nila pareho at maghanap ng ibang paraan para madagdagan ang kaalaman ko. Maybe, they mean well and they know what's best for me."" Pakakawalan na lang ni Marion ang kanyang nararamdaman sa birthday concert niya with her guests Michael Pangilinan, Edgar Allan Guzman, Vin Abrenica, Edward Venoza at nakababatang kapatid niya na si Ashley. Pero bago ang kanyang Take A Chance concert, nakatakda rin siyang mag-perform sa mall shows sa SM Muntinlupa sa March 29, SM Las Pinas sa April 11 at sa isang hotel sa Baguio. Malapit na ring-i-release ng Star Records ang kanyang second album na balak gawing self-titled. It's an 11-track album kasama ang bonus cut na Pumapag-ibig, ang komposisyon para sa kanya ni Jungee Marcelo na entry nila sa Himig-Handog 2014. Tulad ng inaasahan, may sariling compositions din si Marion, bukod sa komposisyon din para sa kanya nina Jonathan Manalo at Joven Tan (yes, ang nag-compose ng award-winning song ni Aiza Seguerra na Ano'ng Nangyari Sa Ating Dalawa, at sa Pare, Mahal Mo Raw Ako ni Michael Pangilinan. Kung dati'y kasing hinhin siya ng kanyang loving mommy, si Maribel ""Lala""Aunor, unti-unti nang nagiging ""sensual"" si Marion na hinihingi ng pagkakataon. Pakinggan ang ika nga'y distinct Aunor sound ni Marion which has captivated those who have heard her sing. It's relaxed, natural singing inherent to the Aunors."
Joy,"Kumubra si Green Bay ng tatlong touchdown sa second half ng laro. Dahil sa pagkakapanalo, tumanggap ang bawat manlalaro ng $15,000. Tinanggap ng American Football League (AFL) founder na si Lamar Hunt ang terminong ""Super Bowl,"" ito ay pormal na ginamit noong 1969 para sa propesyunal championship games. Taong 1970 nang pagsamahin ang AFL at National Football League bilang isang grupo na binubuo ng dalawang conference na may 13 teams."
Shame,"Sa record ng Malabon Police, ang suspek ang itinuturong humalay sa kanyang kapit-bahay noong Agosto 2008. Simula noon hindi na ito nagpakita sa kanilang lugar si Cortezo at hindi na rin ito dumalo sa mga pagdinig sa Malabon Regional Trial Court Branch 73 kung kaya inisyuhan na siya ng warrant of arrest ni Judge Carlos Flores sa kasong rape. Dakong 5:00 noong Martes ng umaga, may nagtimbre sa mga tauhan ng Warrant and Subpoena Section (WSS) ng Malabon Police na nakitang pagala-gala sa kanilang lugar si Cortezo."

Fear,"Naniniwala si Baldwin na magiging napakahirap ng kanilang pagdaraanang proseso para sa seleksiyon dahil sa dami ng available na talents kung ikukumpara sa mga dati na niyang nahawakang national teams na New Zealand, Lebanon at Jordan. ""We will select the pool, and as of this point, a lot is still in the works. But I intend to work with the PBA coaches and the collegiate coaches, take their advice on board because they are my references for these players and we will work with them to select the players. And from that point, I believe that the players should fight it out to get these uniforms,"" ani Baldwin. Sinabi rin ng 4-time NBL Coach of the Year na naiiba ang Pinoy basketball players kung ihahambing sa kanyang mga nahawakang manlalaro sa ibang bansa. ""The pool of talent is deeper, especially in the guard position. But the level of talent is slightly different with other countries."" Sa kabila aniya ng napakarami nang Filipino-foreign players na dumating sa bansa, hindi nagbago ang kultura ng mga Pinoy o ang kakaibang istilo nila ng paglalaro dahil kabaligtaran ang nangyayari na ang mga bagong salta ang yumayakap sa kultura ng local bred players."
Neutral,"Napag-iwanan lamang ng isang panalo ng Fresh Fighters ang Rising Suns na may taglay na malinis na barahang 7-0 (panalo-talo) kaya't sisikapin nilang tumabla sa una sa pagsabak nila kontra sa Tanduay Light sa tampok na laro sa ganap na alas-4:00 ng hapon. Sa panig naman ng kanilang kalaban, maghahabol ang mga ito upang makabangon mula sa natamong pagkabigo sa kamay ng Jumbo Plastic sa nakaraan nilang laban at masiguro ang huling slot sa playoff round. Taglay ang barahang 4-4 (panalo-talo), tatargetin ng Rum Masters ang ikalimang panalo para umagwat sa bumubuntot sa kanila na AMA University (3-5) na may tsansa pang makahabol sa kanila kung magwawagi sa huling dalawa nilang laban at mabigo naman ang Tanduay. Magkasunod naman sa ikatlo at ikaapat na puwesto kabuntot ang namumunong Hapee at Cagayan, magpapakatatag sa kanilang kapit sa posisyon ang Gems at Bakers sa kanilang pagtitipan sa ikalawang laro sa ganap na alas-2:00 ng hapon. Kung outright semifinals berth ang nakalaan sa top two teams sa pagtatapos ng elims, bentaheng twice-to-beat naman ang makakamit ng magtatapos sa No. 3 at No. 4 teams papasok sa quarters kontra sa aakyat sa No. 5 at No. 6 squad. Kapwa galing sa mahabang break, halos patas ang nakikitang laban sa pagitan ng Cebuana (4-3) at Cafe France (6-2) kung saan ay inaasahan ang mas matinding laro para sa hinahangad na tagumpay."
Neutral,"Sinabi ni Deputy Presidential Spokesperson Abigail Valte na gaya noon, magagawa ng DSWD na malagpasan ang anumang kontrobersiya, kabilang na ang nasabing alegasyon ng COA. ""It's not the first time na nagkaroon po ng mga ganitong observations ang COA sa DSWD, and in our past experience, lagi naman pong nasasagot ng DSWD 'yung mga audit observations ng COA to their satisfaction,"" sabi ni Valte. ""Katulad po in this case, ang nangyari ay hindi po nai-include 'yung management's response doon ho sa COA report. I understand that Gamoteait was submitted by DSWD noong November,"" dagdag pa ni Valte. ""Nailabas ho 'yung report 'nung December 15 at naibigay po ito doon sa ahensiyang involved, which is DSWD, at hindi po naisama 'yung kanilang management's response. Importante po na maisama ito para ma-consider din po ng COA ang sagot ng DSWD,"" aniya pa. ""In the past years, ang nangyayari po kasi naiiwan 'yung datos. Kumbaga, 'yung mga datos po natin mula doon sa regional offices ay hindi po minsan umaabot doon sa cut-off, so kailangan po talagang hatakin ng central office para maipasa po 'yan sa COA,"" sabi pa ni Valte. Sa COA report para sa 2013 na inilabas nitong Disyembre 15, 2014, natuklasang may 4,300 double entry sa listahan ng mga benepisyaryo ng CCT na umaabot sa P46.502 milyon."
Fear,"Magugunita na noong 1995, sa buwan ng Enero rin, natuklasang may banta sa buhay ni Pope John Paul II nang dumating ito para sa pagdiriwang ng World Youth Day sa Maynila. Isang nagngangalang Ramszi Ahmed ang naaresto sa isang raid sa kanyang tinutuluyang silid sa Josefa Apartment sa Maynila. Si Ahmed ay isang international terrorist na may misyong paslangin si Pope John Paul II. Sa nadaang mga pagbisita ng mga pinakamataas na pinuno ng Iglesya Katolika noong 1970 at 1995, hindi exempted ang Pilipinas sa kapahamakang maaaring idulot sa mga Papa. At hindi rin exempted si Pope Francis. Kaya naman mahigit 20,000 pulis at 37,000 sundalo ang titiyak sa kaligtasan ng Papa mula sa pagdating at pag-alis nito sa bansa. Idalangin natin ang kanyang kaligtasan, saan mang sulok ng daigdig siya magpunta."

Ano ang gagawin ni Iris sa kapag napunta na sa kanya ang parusa at tuluyan na siyang maging aso? Ang matibay na samahan at pagmamahalan ba ng mag-ama ang magiging susi upang matanggal na ang sumpa? Sa huli, matututuhan na ba ni Iris na pahalagahan ang pagmamahal at pagprotekta ng kanyang tatay para sa kanila ng kanyang kapatid?"
Sadness,"Reuters - Naospital ang boxing legend na si Muhammad Ali dahil sa pneumonia at inaasahang makakarekober dahil maagang na-diagnose ang sakit, ayon sa isang spokesman kamakalawa.

""The matter was referred yesterday. No further action [in our office] is scheduled on this matter."" Kung iisipin si Bynes, na umaming may bipolar disorder, ay nagbabagong buhay at makalipas ang dalawang taon na hindi magagandang pangyayari sa buhay niya, siya ay naaresto noong Setyembre 28 dahil sa pagmamaneho nang lasing. Ito ay nagdulot ng hindi magandang pangyayari, kasama na rito ang isang shoplifting incident, hindi kusang loob na pagkakadala sa isang psychiatric treatment, at kawalan ng matutuluyan habang hindi nakakasundo ang magulang."
Fear,"Magugunita na sa unang pagkakataon, nagsalita ang LGBT laban sa pang-aabuso, diskriminasyon at kaharasan noong Hunyo 28, 1969, na mas kilala bilang Stonewall Riots sa Greenwich sa New York, at hanggang ngayon ay iisa pa rin ang minimithi nito--at ito ay ang ""EQUALITY. Walang labis, Walang kulang."" Nais baguhin ng nasabing grupo ang mga negatibong pagkakakilanlan sa kanila na nagiging balakid upang kanilang maabot ang mga pangarap.

Sa 15-pahinang reklamo, inakusahan ni Syjuco si Purisima ng paglabag sa Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act sa pakikialam sa Oplan Exodus kahit na suspendido sa tungkulin noon pang Disyembre 2014. Sinabi ni Syjuco na mismong si Pangulong Benigno S. Aquino III ay umamin na may ""lack of coordination"" sa puwersa ng gobyerno at sa Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) nang isagawa ang Oplan Exodus at alam din ni Purisima ang tungkol sa operasyon na hindi ipinabatid kina Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Manuel Roxas at acting PNP chief Deputy Director Gen. Leonardo Espina. ""As many claimed, Purisima not only knew of the operation, but actually controlled and directed the operations, despite his being currently suspended from duty,"" ani Syjuco. Dagdag niya, ""The fatal covert operation that killed 44 members of the elite SAF had been assigned by President Benigno Aquino to suspended National Police Chief Alan Purisima, apparently without the knowledge of Interior Secretary Manuel 'Mar' Roxas. On this point alone, it may well be said that Aquino considered Purisima as still the 'de facto PNP chief' in assigning to him the sensitive mission, despite his suspended status,"" saad sa reklamo. Giit ni Syjuco, marami at malinaw ang mga ebidensiya na nagpapatunay na pinangasiwaan nga ni Purisima ang operasyon sa Mamasapano kahit pa suspendido ito ng Ombudsman."

Sadness,"Sa kabila ng bugso ng kanilang damdaming Kristiyano, tiniis nilang huwag lumingon kay Pope Francis - isang tuwirang pagtupad sa tungkuling magmatyag sa ano mang masamang elemento na makapagpapahamak sa Papa. At nasaksihan buong mundo ang kanilang kahanga-hangang pagtupad ng tungkulin dahil sa live feed ng media ng kapwa Pinoy at banyaga. Minsan pa, ating naipakita sa buong mundo na ang Pilipino ay may diwang 'Tungkulin muna, bago ang sarili'. Sa bawat miyembro ng pulisya na naatasan sa tungkuling pangalagaan ang mahalagang pagbisitang ito ni Pope Francis, isang marubdob na pasasalamat mula sa sambayanan. Hindi ninyo binigo si Juan Dela Cruz na labis-labis na nag-aalala sa kaligtasan ng Papa hanggang sa pag-alis niya. Sa pamunuan ng PNP at ng DILG, thumbs up po kami sa inyong pagsisikap!"

Para naman sa kanyang sarili, boykot ang byuti ni Vice sa Araw ng mga Puso. Binanggit kasi ng Unkabogable Star na hindi raw siya magdiriwang ng Valentine's Day kahit na sabihin pang meron siyang special someone. ""Paano kami magba-Valentine's date hindi nga kami lumalabas? Last year sa bahay lang. Ngayon, hindi pa namin alam,"" banggit pa ng Phenomenal Box Office Star. Ipinagmalaki ni Vice na isa siyang romantikong tao pero ang higit na importante ngayon ay masaya siya at inspirado hindi lang sa trabaho kundi pati na rin sa personal niyang buhay. ""Lahat naman tayo, dapat lagi tayong inspired. Hindi naman kinakailangang dyowa mo ang isang tao. P'wede namang nai-inspire ka niya everyday, hindi kinakailangan na mayroon kayong relasyon,"" napatawa pang banggit ni Vice. Sa It's Showtime ay ipinagsigawan ni Vice na masaya siya sa kasama niyang inspirasyon ngayon. Nasa cloud nine rin siya dahil katatapos lang niyang pumirma ng multi-picture contract with Star Cinema last Monday. Kaya nga raw grateful siya dahil sa sunud-sunod ang blessings na ibinibigay sa kanya. ""'Yung Diyos sobrang misteryoso gumalaw.

Dapat na may tiwala tayo sa Diyos na gagawin Niya ang kanyang tungkulin, na higit pa sa pagtitiwala natin sa jeepney driver na ihahatid tayo sa abot ng ating pamasahe. Ngunit sa awiting iyon, hindi nangangahulugan na hindi na natin gagawin ang ating mga responsibilidad.

Si Thomas Hearns, na nilabanan sina Hagler at Leonard noon, ang nagsabi na ito ay magiging ""awesome fight"" ngunit sa pagalay niya si Floyd ang mananalo. Si Roberto Duran, na lumutang din ang katanyagan sa boxing sa pakikipaglaban kina Hagler, Leonard, at Hearns, ang nagsabi, ""I have always thought Pacquiao would win."" Ang huling sport heroes ay hati rin ang opinyon. Sinabi ni former heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield at middleweight champion Miguel Cotto na kay Manny sila. Sinabi naman ni Oscar Dela Hoya na parehong matinding sumuntok ang dalwa ngunit si Floyd ang may perfect timing. Anang mga oddsmaker (tagahula ng magiging resulta ng tunggalian sa sports) sa Amerika, bahagyang paborito si Mayweather. Undefeated sa 47 laban, kilala siya sa kanyang mahusay na depensa. Ngunit si Pacquiao, na isang southpaw na may record na 50 panalo, limang talo, at dalawang draw, ay kilala sa bilis ng kanyang mga suntok. Magiging labanan ito ng dalawang magkaibang estilo sa boxing - superb defense versus perpetual motion. Sa pagitan ng stamina at bilis ng kamao. Ang mga dakila sa boxing sa daigdig ay magdedebate sa dalawang estilong ito sa susunod na anim na linggo at sa pagsapit ng dakilang araw na iyon - Sabado nang gabi, Mayo 2, sa Las Vegas, na Linggo nang umaga, Mayo 3, sa Pilipinas."
Fear,"Kasunod nito, dalawang bahay naman sa Sitio Mambog sa Bgy. Sula, San Jose, ang nilamon ng apoy. Ang mga bahay ay pag-aari nina Marlon Doctolero, 49; at Jimboy Doctolero, 22, kapwa magsasaka."
Anger,"PORT WASHINGTON, Wis. (AP) -- Humarap na sa korte ang Saved by the Bell aktor na si Dustin Diamond para sa kasong inihain laban sa kanya sa usaping pananaksak sa Wisconsin bar noong araw ng Pasko. Ayon sa kanyang abogado, wala kahit isa sa mga nakasaksi ang nakakita na nanaksak ang aktor, ngunit ayon sa Ozaukee County judge ay mayroong sapat na ebidensiya upang ipagpatuloy ang kaso sa hukuman."
Neutral,"""With 13 continental and two national squads, the 2015 Le Tour will definitely be the most exciting,"" sabi ni Lina-Flavier. ""Unlike in the past editions when club teams joined the race, this time, the Le Tour has made its name as one of the most competitive in Asia."" Ang continental teams na magbabalik sa Le Tour ay ang Satalyst Giant Racing Team (Australia), CCN Cycling Team (Brunei), Astana Continental Team (Kazakhstan), Pegasus Continental Cycling Team (Indonesia), TPT Cycling Team (Iran), Terengganu Cycling Team (Malaysia), Bridgestone Anchor Cycling Team (Japan) at 7-Eleven (Philippines). Sila ay sasamahan ng Le Tour first-timers na Team Novo Nordisk (USA), RTS Carbon (Taiwan), Attaque Team Gusto (Taiwan), Pishgaman Yazd Pro Cycling Team (Iran) at Singha Infinite Cycling Team (Thailand). Ang pambansang koponan ng PhilCycling ay sasabak din bilang bahagi ng kanilang paghahanda para sa Asian Road and Track Championships sa huling bahagi ng Pebrero at ng Singapore Southeast Asian Games sa Hunyo. Ipapadala rin ng Uzbekistan ang pambansang koponan nito upang maging matalas at handa para sa Asian championships. Ang 2015 Le Tour ay magbabalik sa maalamat na ruta sa Kennon Road patungong Baguio City sa Stage Four. Ang Kennon Road ay kinilala sa kasaysayan ng Philippine cycling bilang ""maker of champions"" - kung saan ang mga tunay na ""sports heroes on two wheels"" ay naiuukit ang kanilang mga pangalan - sa local Tour. Ang Stage One sa Pebrero 1 ay ang 126-kilometrong Balanga-Balanga route sa Bataan, ang Stage 2 sa Pebrero 2 ay isang 153.75-km ride mula Balangan hanggang Iba sa Zambales at ang Stage 3 sa Pebrero 3 ay sasakupin ang 149.34- kilometro mula Iba hanggang Lingayen, Pangasinan. Para sa Stage 4 sa Pebrero 4, ang Le Tour, na napasama sa Visit the Philippines 2015 program ng Department of Tourism, ay ang karera mula Lingayen hanggang Baguio City sa pamamagitan ng Kennon Road at may habang 101 kilometro."
Anger,"Granada, Joe Aspiras, at Blas Ople. Noong 1959, sinabi sa akin ng aking editor-publisher at Manila Times correspondent Felipe ""Pep"" Delfin na makipagkita ako kay Blas Ople sa isang event ng Capiz Press Club sa Roxas City. Ipinarating ko sa kanya ang pagnanais ng Aklan journalists at student leaders na makipagkita sa kanya. Pumayag siya at bumiyahe kami ng 25 minuto lulan ng isang eroplano mula Loctogan airport patungong Kalibo. Kahit noon pa man, pamilyar na si Ka Blas sa mga personalidad sa Aklan tulad nina Congressman Godofredo Ramos, Dr. Artemio Nabor, at magkapatid na Beato at Roman Dela Cruz, lahat kilalang manunulat. Sa loob ng isang linggo, nakapulong niya ang Aklan nationalist advocates ng National Progress Movement (NPM) kung saan naglingkod siya bilang national vice chairman sa ilalim ng chairman nito na si retired Col. Mohammad De Venancio. Sapagkat batid niya ang aking pagiging College Editors Guild of the Philippines (CEGP) Vice president, at Conference Delegates Association (CONDA) Asian Youth Forum chairman, pati na ang mga limitasyon sa paglinang ng aking aktibong interes sa student at youth movements, isinama niya ako sa Maynila at ipinakilala sa kanyang mga kaibigan at mga kakilala at kay NPC president Mac Vicencio, na humimok sa aking maging aktibo sa mga gawain ng NPC bilang isa sa mga halal na opisyal nito. Kalaunan, hiniling sa akin ni Vicencio na organisahin ang Federation of Provincial Press Clubs of the Philippines (FPPCP) kung saan binuo nina Ka Doroy Valencia, Ople, Ernie Granada, Mao Chanco, Leon Aureus ng Bicol at Joe Aspiras bilang kaakibat ng NPC, naging premyadong kapatiran ng mga peryodista ng bansa. Taglay ang inspirasyon at patnubay ni Ka Blas, naging pangulo ako kalaunan ng Manila Overseas Press Club and the Publishers Association of the Philippines, Inc. bukod sa pagiging director ng Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO), at Philippine National Red Cross governor, UNESCO commissioner, National Book Development Board (NBDB) governor, at National Development Company director at Philippines Graphic publisher. Ginawa rin niya akong miyembro ng kanyang maraming misyon sa ibayong dagat. Bukod sa kanyang legasiya ng overseas employment program, tumulong din si Ka Blas sa pagpapahusay ng major players sa gobyerno at sa pribadong sektor."
